# Minimum Spanning Tree

- If a graph has `n` vertices, then the minimum spanning tree will have `n-1` edges.
- A minimum spanning tree is a tree that connects all the vertices of the graph and has the minimum possible total edge weight.
- A graph can have multiple minimum spanning trees.
- Example of a minimum spanning tree:
