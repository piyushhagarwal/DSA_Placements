# Heaps

Heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

## Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

There are two types of heaps:

1. Max Heap : Any node should be less than or equal to its parent node and the root node should be the largest element.
2. Min Heap : Any node should be greater than or equal to its parent node and the root node should be the smallest element.

Formulas for finding the parent and child nodes:
If we consider the root node as `i = 1` then:

1. Parent node: `i/2`
2. Left child node: `2*i`
3. Right child node: `2*i + 1`
