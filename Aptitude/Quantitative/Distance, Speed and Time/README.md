Question 1: A person covered a certain distance at some speed. Had he moved 4 km/hr faster, he would have taken 30 minutes less. If he had moved 3 km/hr slower, he would have taken 30 minutes more. Find the distance (in km)  
Solution: Distance = [S1S2/ (S1– S2)] x T  
S1 = initial speed  
S2 = new speed  
Distance travelled by both are same so put equal  
[S (S + 4) / 4 ] \* (30/60) =[ S (S – 3)/ 3 ]\* (30/60)  
S = 24  
Put in 1st
Distance=(24 \* 28) / 4 \* (30/60) = 84 km
