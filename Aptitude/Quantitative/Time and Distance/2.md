### An old man takes 30 mins and a young man takes 20 mins to walk from town A to town B. If one day the old man started at 10:00 am and the young man at 10:05 am, at what time will they meet?

## Solution

Let the distance between town A and town B be `x` km.

Speed of old man = `x/30`
Speed of young man = `x/20`

Let the time taken by old man to meet young man is `t`.

So the time taken by young man would be `t-5` mins.

`x/30 * t = x/20 * (t-5)`

`=> t = 15 mins`

So, they will meet at `10:15 am`.
