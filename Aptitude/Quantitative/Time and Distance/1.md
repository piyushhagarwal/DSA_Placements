### 1. If a student walks from his house to school at 5km/hr, he is late by 30 mins. However if he walks at 6km/hr he reaches is late by 5 mins. Find the distance between his house and school.

## Solution

Let the distance between his house and school be `x` km.

If he walks at 5km/hr, he is late by 30 mins. So, the time taken to reach school is `x/5 + 1/2` hours.

If he walks at 6km/hr, he is late by 5 mins. So, the time taken to reach school is `x/6 + 1/12` hours.

Since the time taken to reach school is same in both cases, we can equate the two equations.

`x/5 + 1/2 = x/6 + 1/12`

`=> x = 25/2`
