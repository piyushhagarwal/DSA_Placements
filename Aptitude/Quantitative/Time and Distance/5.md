### A thief is spotted by a policeman from a distance of 100m. When the policeman starts the chase, the thief also starts running. If the speed of the thief was 8 km/hr and that of the policeman 10 km/hr, how far would the thief have run before he was overtaken?

## Solution

Let the distance run by the thief before he was overtaken be `x` km.

Total distance run by policemen = `x + 0.1` km.

Both thief and policeman started at the same time. So, the time taken by both of them would be same.

`x/8 = (x + 0.1)/10`

`=> x = 0.4 km`

So, the thief would have run `0.4 km` before he was overtaken.
