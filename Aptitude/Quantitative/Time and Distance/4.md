### One day, Ramesh started 30 minutes late from home and, driving at 25% slower than the usual speed, reached the market 50 minutes late. How much time in minutes does Ramesh usually take to reach the market from home?

## Solution

Let the usual speed of Ramesh is `u`  
and the usual time taken by him is `t minutes`

Now, ramesh started 30 minutes late from home and driving at 25% slower than the usual speed, reached the market 50 minutes late.  
Therefore, The time taken by him to reach market is: 50-30= `20 minutes`  
Now as his speed is 25% slower than usual
it means u x 25%= `0.75 u` and the time by him is `(t+20) minutes`

hence the usual speed is:  
t x u= (t+20) x 0.75 u  
or, 15= 0.25t  
or, t= 60

Hence, the usual time taken by Ramesh to reach the market from home is `60 minutes`
