### John is faster than Peter. John and Peter each walk 24 km. Sum of the speeds of John and Peter is 7 km/h. Sum of time taken by them is 14 hours. Find Johnâ€™s speed.

- 4 km/h
- 5 km/h
- 3 km/h
- 7 km/h

## Solution

Let's denote John's speed as
J (in km/h) and Peter's speed as P(in km/h).

Since John is faster than Peter, J > P.

We know that distance = speed \* time.

So, John's time = 24/J and Peter's time = 24/P.

Sum of time taken by John and Peter is 14 hours.

- 24/J + 24/P = 14
- J + P = 7 km/hr

Now by substituting options one by one in the above equation, we can find the value of J.

Let's substitute `J = 4 km/hr`.
