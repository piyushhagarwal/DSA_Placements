### Q5. If 4 men or 6 boys can finish a piece of work in 20 days, in how many days can 6 men and 11 boys together finish the same work?

## Solution

- 4 men in 1 day = 1/20
- 1 men in 1 day = 1/80
- 6 boys in 1 day = 1/20
- 1 boy in 1 day = 1/120

6 men and 11 boys together in 1 day = (6 \* 1/80) + (11 \* 1/120) = 1/6 .

So, they will finish the work in `6 days`.
