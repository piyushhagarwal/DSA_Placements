### Q4. A & B can do a piece of work in 45 and 40 days respectively. They began to do the work together but A leaves after some days and then B completed the remaining work in 23 days. After how many days did A leave?

## Solution:

- A's 1 day work = 1/45
- B's 1 day work = 1/40

(A + B)'s 1 day work = 1/45 + 1/40 = 17/360

Let A leaves after x days. So, B alone does the remaining work in 23 days.

So, (A + B)'s x day's work + B's 23 day's work = 1

- 17x/360 + 23/40 = 1
- 17x/360 = 1 - 23/40 = 17/40
- 17x/360 = 17/40
- x = 360/40 = 9

So, A leaves after `9 days`.
