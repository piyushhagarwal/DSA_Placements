# Problem Statement

## Q1. Time to Complete Work Together

If Roger can do a piece of work in 8 days and Antony can do the same work in 5 days, in how many days will both of them do it together?

# Solution

Let's find the work rates for Roger and Antony.

Roger's rate = 1/8 (because Roger can do the work in 8 days)
Antony's rate = 1/5 (because Antony can do the work in 5 days)

When they work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
Combined rate = Roger's rate + Antony's rate = 1/8 + 1/5.

To add these fractions, you need a common denominator, which is 40 in this case:
Combined rate = (5/40) + (8/40) = 13/40.

So, together, they complete 13/40 of the work per day.

Now, let \(x\) be the number of days it takes for both of them to complete the work together.

The total work is 1 (the whole piece of work), and the formula relating work, rate, and time is \( \text{work} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \).

For Roger and Antony working together:  
\[ 1 = \frac{13}{40} \times x \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{40}{13} \]

Therefore, both of them will complete the work together in approximately \(3.08\) days.
