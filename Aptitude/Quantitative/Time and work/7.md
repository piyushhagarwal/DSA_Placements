### Q7. An exam was conducted and the following was analyzed. 4 men were able to check some exam papers in 8 days working 5 hours regularly. What is the total number of hours taken by 2 men in 20 days to check double the number of exam papers?

## Solution

- 4 men working 5 hours daily for 8 days complete the work. So, the total work is 4 \* 5 \* 8 = 160 man-hours.

- So to check double the number of exam papers we require double man-hours = 160 \* 2 = 320

Let x be the hours to work daily  
=> 2 \* x \* 20 = 320  
=> x = 8

So, `8 hours` daily for 20 days is required to check double the number of exam papers.
