### Q1. If Roger can do a piece of work in 8 days and Antony can do the same work in 5 days, in how many days will both of them do it together?

## Solution

Let's find the work rates for Roger and Antony.

- Roger's work in 1 day = 1/8
- Antony's work in 1 day = 1/5

When they work together, their combined work in 1 day = 1/8 + 1/5 = 13/40

So, together, they complete 13/40 of the work per day.

To complete the work, they will need `40/13` days.
