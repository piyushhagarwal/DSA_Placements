### Q6. A takes 3 days to complete a work while B takes 2 days. Both of them finish a work and earn Rs. 150. What is Aâ€™s share of money? (Hint - money should be divided.. in the ratio of how much work a person does in 1 day)

## Solution

- A's 1 day work = 1/3
- B's 1 day work = 1/2
- A and B's 1 day work = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6

Now, the ratio of A's work to the total work is A's rate divided by the total rate:
A's share = (1/3) / (5/6) = 2/5.

So, A's share of money = 2/5 \* 150 = 60
