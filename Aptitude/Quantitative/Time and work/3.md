### Q3. A & B can do the work in 18 days, B & C can do the work in 24 days, A & C can do the work in 36 days. In how many days can A, B and C together do the work? In how many days A can do the work alone?

## Solution

- A & B combined work in one day = 1/18
- B & C combined work in one day = 1/24
- A & C combined work in one day = 1/36

1. 1/A + 1/B = 1/18
2. 1/B + 1/C = 1/24
3. 1/A + 1/C = 1/36

Adding all the equations, we get:  
2 \* (1/A + 1/B + 1/C) = 1/18 + 1/24 + 1/36 = 9/72  
=> 1/A + 1/B + 1/C = 1/16

So, A, B and C combined work in one day = 1/16

So, A, B and C together can do the work in `16 days`.

- 1/A + (1/B + 1/C) = 1/16
- 1/A + 1/24 = 1/16
- 1/A = 1/16 - 1/24 = 1/48

So, A can do the work in `48 days`.
