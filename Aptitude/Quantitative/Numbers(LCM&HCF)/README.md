## 1. Coprime Numbers

Coprime numbers, also known as relatively prime or mutually prime numbers, are integers that have no common positive integer other than 1 as a divisor. In other words, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.

**Example:**

- 9 and 16 are coprime because the only positive integer that divides both is 1.

## 2. Product of Two Numbers = HCF \* LCM

The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their Highest Common Factor (HCF) and their Lowest Common Multiple (LCM).

This relationship is useful in solving problems involving factors and multiples of numbers.

## 3. Arithmetic Progression (AP) and Geometric Progression (GP) Formulas

### Arithmetic Progression (AP)

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two consecutive terms is always the same.

**Formula:**
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

- \( a_n \): nth term
- \( a \): first term
- \( n \): number of terms
- \( d \): common difference

**Example:**
\[ 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots \]

### Geometric Progression (GP)

A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which the ratio of any two consecutive terms is always the same.

**Formula:**
\[ a_n = a \times r^{(n-1)} \]

- \( a_n \): nth term
- \( a \): first term
- \( r \): common ratio
- \( n \): number of terms

**Example:**
\[ 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots \]

These formulas are essential in understanding and working with sequences in mathematics.
