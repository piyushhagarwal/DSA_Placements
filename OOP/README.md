# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Explained with Real-Life Examples

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts repository! In this repository, I have provided a comprehensive explanation of various OOP concepts, using practical real-life examples to enhance your conceptual understanding. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, helping you grasp these fundamental concepts in a meaningful way.

## What's Inside?

The repository covers a wide range of OOP concepts, including but not limited to:

1. [Type casting](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/1.TypeCasting.java)
2. [Static variables, methods, and blocks](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/2.Static.java)
3. [Encapsulation](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/3.Encapsulation.java)
4. [Inheritance](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/4.Inheritance.java)
5. [Overriding](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/5.Overriding.java)
6. [Access modifiers](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/6.AccessModifiers.java)
7. [super and this keywords](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/7.SuperThis.java)
8. [Polymorphism](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/8.Polymorphism.java)
9. [final keyword](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/9.Final.java)
10. [Abstract classes and methods](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/10.Abstract.java)
11. [Interfaces](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/11.Interface.java)
12. [Loose coupling](https://github.com/piyushhagarwal/Placements/blob/main/OOP/12.LooseCoupling.java)
